# sortAlg.cpp
An outlined cpp file of merge sort algorithm

Merge Sort is an O(nlogn) comparison-based sorting algorithm.
Most implementations produce a stable sort. It's like a divide
and conquer algorithm. I decided to implement this sorting 
algorithm using an array. I chose this algorithm because it breaks
things down by half and deals with the sort in small portions
before combining into one big list. I relate with this very much 
because this is my approach in life with daily activities.
Especially in school, when I get a new assingment or an exam,
I try to use the divide and conquer approach and it always seem
to work for me.
